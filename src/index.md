Title: 140c RPG

> Can we actually design a (playable) RPG system that would fit in a tweet?

## Current version

(published: 2014-07-16 - 140c)

    STR/DEX/INT spread -2,0,+1
    +1:Warrior/STR,Thief/DEX,Mage/INT
    HP:6+STR+lvl
    Act:2d6+stat(-1/HP<6). 6-:KO, 7-9:so-so, 10+:OK
    Spell: INT+lvl/day

### Detailed explanation

Note: Characters start at Level 0.

* Three **stats**, STRength, DEXterity, INTelligence,
* Spread -2, 0 and +1 **scores** for these stats the way you want. (e.g. 0 for *STR*, +1 to *DEX* and -2 for *INT*)
* Pick a **class**: Warrior, Thief or Mage. Each one of them gives you a +1 bonus in *STR*, *DEX* and *INT* respectively.
* **Hits Points** equal to 6 + your *STR* + your Level.
* **Actions** are solved using two 6-sided dice, adding the corresponding stat. If the result is below 6, you fail. If it's between 7 and 9, it's a mixed result, if it's above 10, it's a success.
* In case you've lost Hit Points, add a -1 malus to your rolls for every HP below 6.
* Magicians can cast **spells** up to your *INT* score + Level per day.

You see? easy!

## Class-less variant

(a.k.a *the Grand Vernois* - 137c)

    Lvl: 0
    STR/DEX/INT (-2<=stat<=+1, sum==0)
    HP: 6+STR+lvl
    Act: 2d6+stat(-1/HP<6) 6-:KO, 7-9:so-so, 10+:OK
    Spell: INT+lvl/day if Magic-aware

In this variant, you don't have a class bonus. You can spread your scores the same way, with the only limitation to have your all your stats between -2 and +1 (inclusive) and the sum of your stats should equals to 0.

Now you can play a Warrior with -2 to his/her *STR* score.
