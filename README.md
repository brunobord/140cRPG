# 140c Role-Playing Game

This is the website for the *140c Role-Playing Game* project.

It started by the "Quest" for the smallest RPG system possible, and ended up in
this tongue-in-cheek challenge:

> Can we actually design a (playable) RPG system that would fit in a tweet?

## Current version

(published: 2014-07-16 - 140c)

    STR/DEX/INT spread -2,0,+1
    +1:Warrior/STR,Thief/DEX,Mage/INT
    HP:6+STR+lvl
    Act:2d6+stat(-1/HP<6). 6-:KO, 7-9:so-so, 10+:OK
    Spell: INT+lvl/day


### Class-less variant

(a.k.a "the Grand Vernois" - 137c)

    Lvl: 0
    STR/DEX/INT (-2<=stat<=+1, sum==0)
    HP: 6+STR+lvl
    Act: 2d6+stat(-1/HP<6) 6-:KO, 7-9:so-so, 10+:OK
    Spell: INT+lvl/day if Magic-aware

## Acknowledgements

The "Act" resolution system is borrowed from the Apocalypse World RPG engine ; it's rock solid and has been playtested by hundreds.

## More to come...

* [WIP] Actually build a website out of this document,
* Advanced rules that would develop the "fuzzy" areas (Fights, Magic, Levels). My intent is to squeeze each section to a maximum of 140c.
* Variants and spin-offs (Cthulhu, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Zombie, Cowboys,...)
